# Arduino ESP32 Build Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to enable successful Arduino ESP32 builds.

## Issue 1: Tool Registry Header Conflicts

The headers `tool_registry.h` and `tool_info.h` had duplicate definitions of several structures and enums, causing compilation errors.

### Solution:

1. In `tool_registry.h`:
   - Removed duplicate enum definition of `MCP_ToolResultStatus` and used the one from `tool_info.h`
   - Renamed `MCP_ToolResult` to `MCP_ToolResultExtended` to avoid conflict
   - Renamed `MCP_ToolHandler` to `MCP_ToolHandlerExtended`
   - Renamed `MCP_ToolStep` to `MCP_ToolStepExtended`
   - Renamed `MCP_ToolDefinition` to `MCP_ToolDefinitionRegistry`
   - Updated function declarations to use the new type names

2. In `tool_registry.c`:
   - Updated function implementations to match the renamed types
   - Renamed conflicting functions to avoid linker errors

## Issue 2: Arduino ESP32 Build Process

The build process for Arduino ESP32 needed to be fixed to properly include only the Arduino HAL, not the ESP32 HAL.

### Solution:

1. Modified the `build.sh` script to:
   - Create an Arduino project structure with the correct file organization
   - Only include the Arduino HAL (not ESP32 HAL)
   - Create a simplified test sketch to verify the HAL structure
   - Copy required source files to the Arduino project

2. Created a simplified test sketch that:
   - Includes the Arduino HAL headers
   - Has a minimal setup and loop implementation
   - Uses pin 2 instead of LED_BUILTIN for ESP32 compatibility

## Testing the Build

The build was successfully tested using:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh arduino --board=esp32 --verbose
```

This confirms that the Arduino HAL is properly structured and included, and the tool registry header conflicts have been resolved.

## Next Steps for Complete Implementation

For a complete implementation, the following would need to be addressed:

1. Implement the missing Arduino HAL functions:
   - log_init
   - log_message
   - MCP_SystemInit
   - MCP_LoadPersistentState
   - MCP_ServerStart
   - MCP_SystemProcess

2. Create a complete Arduino ESP32 example that demonstrates:
   - Using the Arduino HAL with ESP32 board
   - Connecting to WiFi
   - Running the MCP server
   - Processing system tasks

3. Update build documentation to clarify the distinction between:
   - Platform (Arduino, ESP-IDF)
   - Board type (Uno, ESP32)
