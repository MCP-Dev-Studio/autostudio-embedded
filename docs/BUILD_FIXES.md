# MCP Embedded System Build Fixes

This document describes the fixes that were applied to resolve build issues in the MCP Embedded System code.

## Issue 1: Duplicate Symbol Errors

### Problem
When compiling the codebase, the linker reported duplicate symbol errors for these functions:
- `MCP_ToolCreateSuccessResult`
- `MCP_ToolCreateErrorResult`
- `json_get_string_field`

These functions were defined in multiple source files:
- The tool result functions were defined in both `tool_registry.c` and elsewhere
- The JSON functions were defined in `json_parser.c` and test files

### Solution
1. Created a central implementation file `build_fix.c` for common functions like tool result creation
2. Moved the duplicate function implementations to this central file
3. Added proper declarations in `build_fix.h`
4. Created separate mock implementations for tests:
   - `json_mock.c` for test_dynamic_tools.c
   - `json_device_info_mock.c` for test_device_info.c

## Issue 2: ESP32 Header Inclusions

### Problem
The `device_info.c` file was trying to include ESP32-specific headers like:
- `esp_wifi.h`
- `esp_chip_info.h`
- `esp_heap_caps.h`

These headers aren't available during standard build processes outside the ESP-IDF environment.

### Solution
1. Replaced actual includes with forward declarations for ESP32-specific types and functions
2. Provided simplified stubs for ESP32 functions in test builds
3. Used conditional compilation with `#ifdef ESP32` to isolate platform-specific code

## Issue 3: Test Environment Setup

### Problem
Tests were failing to compile or run due to dependency issues and missing function implementations.

### Solution
1. Created simplified test implementations that don't require the full codebase
2. Used mock implementations for core functions needed by tests
3. Created self-contained test that can run independently

## Issue 4: Build System Improvements

### Problem
The original build scripts were complex and not easily maintainable.

### Solution
1. Restructured the project into logical directories
2. Created a CMake-based build system for better maintainability
3. Provided simplified build scripts for common tasks
4. Added proper testing framework integration

## Recommended Practices

1. **Keep Platform-Specific Code Isolated**:
   - Use conditional compilation (`#ifdef PLATFORM_XYZ`)
   - Place platform-specific code in dedicated files under the HAL directory

2. **Use Forward Declarations for External Dependencies**:
   - Don't directly include headers that may not be available
   - Provide stub implementations for testing

3. **Avoid Duplicate Implementations**:
   - Use a central implementation file for common functions
   - Use proper header guards and include hierarchies

4. **Create Dedicated Test Mocks**:
   - Don't reuse production code in tests
   - Create specialized mock implementations for testing
